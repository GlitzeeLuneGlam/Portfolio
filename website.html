        At first I didn't enjoy coding at all, it was completely different to anything I had
        done before and I felt as if I couldn't be as creative as I desired with it.
        But then I chose timezone for my local attraction to make a site around and I
        realised I could give it an old arcade/vaporwave theme and suddenly I was off
        like a dog off their leash. I'm incredibly proud of the final product and I know
        I'll definitely be exploring this creative avenue more in the future.

      I knew going into this I was going to love animation, it just clicks perfectly
      with my brain, every step felt incredibly enjoyable and I absolutely loved the style
      I went with for it. If I were to do it again, I'd definitely play around with spinning
      the character around as he transforms and maybe give more sparkles to his outfit.
